        various platforms from legacy
        system (Mainframe, COBOL, JCL), Unix platforms and different database like DB2,

        <p>I have been recently playing the role of a Business Analyst and decided to take
        break from my work due to
                            the Covid impact to my employer and also due to my inner wanting to explore other skills and opportunities.</p>
         <p>I have always enjoyed problem solving and giving technical advise even in my Business Analyst role. 
           And as I have loved web technologies that I was exposed to in my past experiences, I decided to update my knowledge with the modern FullStack Web development technologies, to add more technical feathers to my cap. </p>
        <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from an
        accredited University in India.

        I am very good in people skills, talking with clients and the customers, and in
                            working with a team. I have excellent analytical, problem solving, investigative skills and compelete things to its perfection.</p>
        <p>Please checkout my Portfolio, that displays various Apps I've deveoped and their respective Github Repositories. 
          And by the way, this Portfolio site was also built by me using React JS. </p>
